# Tetromino Texture
- texture must be a .bmp file named "tetrominoes.bmp"
- path should be in "./assets/tetrominoes.bmp", where "." is the directory of the TetrisLT.exe file
- size must be strictly 192x24
NOTE1: if all conditions above aren't met, the texture won't be loaded
NOTE2: it is safe to delete the default tetrominoes.bmp, it will fallback to rendering just its plain colors

# Audio assets (SFX)
- just follow the default sfx names (e.g. lock.wav, countdown_tick.wav, etc...) any other audio file names will be ignored
- audio file must be .wav
- audio file path should be in "./assets/sfx/[sfx_name].wav", where "." is the directory of the TetrisLT.exe file
NOTE: it is safe to delete sfx files, but no sound will be played in game as a result.
